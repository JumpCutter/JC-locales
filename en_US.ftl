view-start-project-heading = Create Project

choose-a-tool = Choose a tool

silent-threshold = Silent threshold
silent-threshold-tooltip = This determines the threshold at which JumpCutter will make a cut. Setting the number higher will cause it to create more cuts because it will interpret more of the video as silent. Reccomended: {$initialSilentThreshold}

left-padding = Left padding
left-padding-tooltip = This is the amount of padding to add to the start of each cut made by JumpCutter. Recommended: {$initialLeftPadding}

right-padding = Right padding
right-padding-tooltip = This is the amount of padding to add to the start of each cut made by JumpCutter. Recommended: {$initialRightPadding}

vod-id = VOD ID
vod-id-tooltip = Go to your PUBLIC vod on Twitch.tv that you want to have edited. The URL will look something like this (Example https://www.twitch.tv/videos/748327437) Copy the numbers at the end of the URL (Example 748327437) and paste them here!

number-of-highlights = Number of highlights
number-of-highlights-tooltip = Each Highlight will be roughly 30sec. If you choose 10, then it will select the 10 best moments from your stream. Each highlight beginning and end should be refined by you! Recommendation: I typically toss out half the highlights, so if you want a 2.5min highlight video I recommend selecting 10clips. Recommended: {$VODinitialNumHighlights}

length-of-sections = Length of sections
length-of-sections-tooltip = This refines the results. Think if it's like goldilocks. If the number is too big it will miss really good highlights, and if the number is too small it might produce more false positives. Each streamer is different so we are giving you the option to experiment. The default should be fine. Recommended: ${VODinatorInitial.lenSection}

compare-sections = Compare sections
compare-sections-tooltip = This refines the results. Each section is compared to its neighboring sections to determine whether or not data is an outlier. Every bit of data is relative since there is so much fluctuation in audience behavior and retention. If you select 1 it will look at 1 section in both directions. If you select 5 it will look 5 sections in each direction. This determines how relative you want your edits to be. The default should be fine. Recommended: {$VODinitialCompareSection}
